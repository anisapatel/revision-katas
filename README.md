# Fundamentals Revision

A set of problems for practicing fundamentals concepts.

To run focussed tests:

Put a `.only` on an individual test or test block (there's alot!)

or...

Run `npm test <name_of_section>` to narrow down testing output for that section (e.g. `npm test arrays` to run the arrays challenges) and get them passing.

More information can be found (here)[https://jestjs.io/docs/en/cli] for testing with Jest
